            <p>Applications to UK universities (excluding the Open University) and most Colleges of Higher Education must be made through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) for entry to full-time and sandwich first degree courses. Courses in UCAS are listed on the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ucas.com/">UCAS website</a>.</p>
<h2>When to apply</h2>
<p>UCAS started receiving applications for entry in October 2015 from 1 September 2014.</p>
<p>The normal closing date for applications to reach the UCAS office is <strong>15 January 2015</strong>, except for Medicine where the closing date is <strong>15 October 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>You are advised to apply as early as is consistent with having made a careful and considered choice of institutions and courses. It is in your best interests to apply before the 15 January deadline. However, late applications, including those from outside the UK/EU, are in practice accepted by UCAS and the University of Leicester throughout the remainder of the application year, but are considered at the University’s discretion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The institution code for the University of Leicester is <strong>LEICR L34</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>For all full-time higher education courses at universities and colleges in the UK, students must apply online via UCAS. There are three types of applicant.</p>
<p>For all applications, there are full instructions on the UCAS website to make it as easy as possible for you to fill in your online application, plus help text where appropriate. Please note that your personal statement must be written in your own words.</p>

<h3>Students at a school or college registered with UCAS</h3>
<p>All UK schools and colleges (and a small number of establishments overseas) are registered with UCAS to manage their students’ applications. Advice is available from your teacher or a careers adviser at your school or college. You fill in an online application and submit it to a member of staff. After checking your details and having added the academic reference, your school or college submits the completed application online to UCAS. You pay online using a credit card or debit card. You may also be able to pay through your school or college.</p>
<h3>Independent applicants in the UK</h3>
<p>Other UK applicants, who are not at school or college, apply online independently. It is likely that you are a mature applicant who, unlike school and college students, cannot readily seek advice from your teacher but can instead consult with various careers organisations. You are responsible for paying the correct application fee, for obtaining and attaching the academic reference and for submitting the completed application online to UCAS.</p>
<h3>International applicants outside the UK (EU and worldwide)</h3>
<p>Except for those whose school or college is registered with UCAS, individuals from the EU (excluding the UK), and worldwide, apply online independently. Advice is available from British Council offices and other centres overseas, such as your school or college. You are responsible for paying the correct application fee, for obtaining and attaching the academic reference and for submitting the completed application online to UCAS.</p>
<h2>The Application Process at Leicester</h2>
<p>We will make a decision on your application as quickly as possible. The admissions tutor or Department will contact you directly if you are to be invited for interview, although most courses do not normally interview applicants. If we make you an offer of admission you will receive official notification through UCAS and an offer letter from the University.</p>
<p>The Admissions Tutor will also normally invite you to visit the Department. If you firmly accept our offer, we will send you further information during the Spring of your admission year. If you meet the conditions of our offer and become ‘unconditional firm’ with us, you will be sent further details regarding registration and other matters.</p>
<p>For further information about the application process, please visit the <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/cap/admissions" title="Admissions Office" class="internal-link">Admissions Office website</a> or contact the Admissions Office on 0116 252 5281 or email <a href="mailto:admissions@le.ac.uk">admissions@le.ac.uk</a></p>
<h2>BSc Physiotherapy</h2>
<p>For the&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/study/ugp/physiotherapy" title="Physiotherapy" class="internal-link"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>BSc Physiotherapy</span></span></a> degree which we run with <a class="external-link" href="http://www.coventry.ac.uk/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Coventry University</span></span></a> you should&nbsp;apply as normal through UCAS, selecting Coventry University (C85) as the institution, Physiotherapy (B160) as the course, and Campus Code 3 as the preferred location if you wish to study at Leicester. Further information and help about how to apply to this degree can be obtained from Coventry University on 024 7679 5959 or <a href="mailto:hlsgen@coventry.ac.uk"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>hlsgen@coventry.ac.uk</span></span></a></p>
<h2>Equal Opportunities in Admissions</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University that in considering an application by a prospective student the criterion for selection shall be the potential of the applicant to achieve success in his or her chosen course of study. In assessing this potential, admissions tutors will consider factors relevant to the applicant’s academic aptitude. No applicant will receive less favourable treatment on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, social class, age, disability, colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins. No condition of entry will be imposed which members of a particular group of potential applicants, defined by sex, sexual orientation etc, (as above) are less likely to be able to satisfy than applicants not of that group, unless such a condition is justifiable on academic grounds.</p>
<h2>Data Protection Act 1998</h2>
<p>Any personal data provided by you may be processed by both UCAS and the University in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p>The University of Leicester holds information about students in order to manage student recruitment, admission, registration, study, examination, graduation and other student services such as accommodation and careers. Information is passed between various sections of the University for operational reasons (for example, the Registry notifies changes of address to departments, and other units on a ‘need to know’ basis). Also, it may be disclosed to external agencies to which the University has obligations; for example: Council Tax Registration Officers; Electoral Registration Officers; Higher Education Funding Council for England; Higher Education Statistical Agency; Student Loans Company; Research Councils.</p>
<p>If you have any queries about data protection please email the University’s Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:data.protection@leicester.ac.uk">data.protection@leicester.ac.uk</a> or via the University’s switchboard on 0116 252 2522.&nbsp;</p>
